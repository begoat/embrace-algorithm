The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Note:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Examples:</h5>\n<pre><code>          1\n         / \\\n        2   3\n       / \\\n      4   5\n\nReturn 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Process:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>placeholder</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Answer:</h3>\n<h3>Others Answer:</h3>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"diameterOfBinaryTree"},"fields":{"slug":"/30days-challenge/week2/diameter-of-binary-tree/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/30days-challenge/week2/diameter-of-binary-tree/","previous":"preserved","next":"preserved"}}}
