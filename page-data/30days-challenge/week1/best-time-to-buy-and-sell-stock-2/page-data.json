You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Note:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Examples:</h5>\n<pre><code>Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.\n             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.\n\nInput: [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.\n             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are\n             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.\n\nInput: [7,6,4,3,1]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Process:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>一天只支持一个操作，要么买，要么买了</li>\n<li>这个题目 看下来 有点像 找最大连续的上升子区间 收尾做差，不同区间累加</li>\n</ul>\n<p>是这样的，提交的时候失败了两次，都是 判断 leftBoundary 存在的时候简单的使用了 (!xxx), (xxx) 而不是 === undefined 来判断</p>\n<h3>Answer:</h3>\n<h3>Others Answer:</h3>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"sellStock2"},"fields":{"slug":"/30days-challenge/week1/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-2/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/30days-challenge/week1/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-2/","previous":"preserved","next":"preserved"}}}
