##### Examples:
```
Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

  [9,10,11,12]
]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
```

### Process:
- use a variable to record direction( (0,1,2,3) % 4 ) means four direction, selfAdd if exceed the boundary
- use i,j to loop

- after seeing hints of that problems by others, a more space saving method is maybe keep track of the row/col that have been scaned.
