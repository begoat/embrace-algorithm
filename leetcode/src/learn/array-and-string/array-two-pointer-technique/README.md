### Two-pointer Technique

In the previous chapter, we solve some problems by iterating the array. Typically, we only use one pointer starting from the first element and ending at the last one to do iteration. However, sometimes, we might need to use two pointers at the same time to do the iteration.

#### Summary
* To summarize, one of the typical scenarios to use two-pointer technique is that you want to
  > Iterate the array from two ends to the middle.

  > And it is worth noting that this technique is often used in a sorted array.
